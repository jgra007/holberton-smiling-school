## Description

In this project, I will implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap. I will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledges that I learned previously.

Here the final result:

## Requirements

* You have to use Bootstrap
* Your `styles.css` must be as small as you can - you must use as much as you can Bootstrap classes

---

### [0. Read and be familiar with Figma](README.md)

Important notes with Figma:

* if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: `source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT`
* some values are in float - feel free to round them
* “Be pixel perfect” - yes! but mainly make sure colors, size and position are correct. **#C271FF** is not purple.

For this task, please write an amazing **README.md**

**Interactions note:**

* Web pages must switch to the tablet version when the screen width is 768px
* Web pages must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 576px
* button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
